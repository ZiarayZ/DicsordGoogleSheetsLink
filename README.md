# DicsordGoogleSheetsLink
Reads a channel's pinned messages and puts them into a google sheets document.<br />
The discord server's mods used to manually input people's introductions into a spreadsheet, i decided to make a script which does this automatically (since they're lazy about it).<br />
Currently need to make sure the code has no sensitive data, like bot tokens, account details etc.
